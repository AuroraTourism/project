    <p>There are always many reasons to make a visit to Penang – the beautiful northern state known as the Pearl of The Orient. For tourists, Penang offers many historical buildings and monuments dating back to the British era, as food-lovers enjoy the best of street food in Peninsular. On top of that, 2020 is also Visit Penang Year.</p>
    <p>For instagrammers and tradition-lovers, Penang just adds one more reason to visit the state, but this time it is located on the mainland area. Nestled in the paddy field in a village in Penaga, Kampung Agong is a new tourism landmark in Penang, just a shy 22 minutes – or 14 kilometres away – from Butterworth jetty terminal. If you are not so sure which public transport to take, just dial up cab hailing service and you’ll be there in no time.</p>
    <p>Kampong Agong is unique as it is a replica of an olden kampung life – a village or country living – made alive with life-scale old wooden Malay house, plus the original setting of untouched greenery such as paddy fields, coconut trees and a pond.</p>
    <p>Developed and maintained by a private owner, the place is actually full of attractions and activities. Among activities you can do here include cycling, trekking, photo shooting spots, fishing, or just lying idle by the beautiful ponds and listening to the birds singing and chirping. Made for photoshoot and as a gallery, the old Malay house was an original traditional house in a familiar architecture – with pillars or stilts and high stairs – nicely refurbished and kept in good condition.</p>
